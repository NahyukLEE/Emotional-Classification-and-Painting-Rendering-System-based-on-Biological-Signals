## Application
We use 2 emotion class *'happy'* and *'sad'* for test, and our System can generate paintings depend on user emotions.

## System Flow
The system flow of our project is as follows. 

### a) Recommending reference paintings using Euclidean Distance
Measuring brain waves data and Emotional classification with them. Recommending reference paintings according to the emotional evaluation results.

### b) Rendering using SinGAN example
Rendering paintings for target image using [SinGAN](https://github.com/NahyukLEE/SinGAN).

## Code

### Install dependencies
We recommend you to use Anaconda that already including mandotory packages. 
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Our code was tested with Python 3.6, Pytorch 1.7, CUDA 11.

### Train Emotional Classification Model
To train emotional classification models with your own brain waves dataset(*'ratio.csv'*), you can handle IPython notebook with *'model.ipynb'* . By using *dump* method in *joblib*, you can export your model as *'emotion_modle.pkl'*.

### Generating Paintings
Before you generating paintings, save your image under "SinGAN/Input/Paint", and run the command
```
python main.py
```
