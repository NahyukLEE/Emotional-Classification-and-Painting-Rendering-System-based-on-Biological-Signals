## System Flow
The system flow of our project is as follows. 
![](imgs/SystemFlow.jpg)
1) Measuring brain waves data and Emotional classification with them.
2) Recommending reference paintings according to the emotional evaluation results.
3) Rendering paintings for target image using [SinGAN](https://github.com/NahyukLEE/SinGAN).

## Code

### Install dependencies
We recommend you to use Anaconda that already including mandotory packages. 
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Our code was tested with Python 3.6, Pytorch 1.7, CUDA 11.

### Train Emotional Classification Model
To train emotional classification models with your own brain waves dataset(*'ratio.csv'*), you can handle IPython notebook with *'model.ipynb'* . By using *dump* method in *joblib*, you can export your model as *'emotion_modle.pkl'*.
